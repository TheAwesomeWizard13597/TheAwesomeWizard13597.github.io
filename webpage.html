            <h1>Sensing</h1>
            <p> My robot would use the two ultrasonic
                sensors at the front of the dozer to 
                sense objects in front of it.

            <h1> Planning </h1>
            <p>
                After sensing the objects, the robot would plan based on
                whether or not there was an object there 
                (for example, if there was an object there, turn, otherwise, keep going)

            <h1> Acting </h1>
            <p> 
                The robot would act using its six wheel tank tread driving forward. 
                The plow attachment is completely passive and would stay stationary
                relative to the robot, and would be used to remove obstacles.
